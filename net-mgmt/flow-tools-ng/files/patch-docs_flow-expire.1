+.SH NAME
+flow-expire \- Manage storage of flow file archives by expiring old data.
+.SH SYNOPSIS
+
+\fBflow-expire\fR [ \fB-h\fR ] [ \fB-d\fI debug_level\fB\fR ] [ \fB-e\fI expire_count\fB\fR ] [ \fB-E\fI expire_size\fB\fR ] \fB-w\fI workdir\fB\fR
+
+.SH "DESCRIPTION"
+.PP
+The \fBflow-expire\fR utility will remove the oldest flow files
+in a directory based on either a count of files or space utilization.  The
+directory is recursively searched for flow files.  Files that do not have a
+flow-tools signature will be ignored.  The internal timestamp is used so
+backups or copies of the flow files that do not retain the original
+timestamp will not impact the operation of \fBflow-expire\fR\&. 
+\fBflow-expire\fR is typically used to manage storage in
+a distributed environment where flows are collected on a different
+server than they are archived.
+.SH "OPTIONS"
+.TP
+\fB-d\fI debug_level\fB\fR
+Enable debugging.
+.TP
+\fB-e\fI expire_count\fB\fR
+Retain the maximum number of files so that the total file count is
+less than \fIexpire_count\fR\&.
+.TP
+\fB-E\fI expire_size\fB\fR
+Retain the maximum number of files so that the total storage is less
+than \fIexpire_size\fR\&.  The letters b,K,M,G can
+be used as multipliers, ie 16 Megabytes is 16M.
+.TP
+\fB-h\fR
+Display help.
+.TP
+\fB-w\fI workdir\fB\fR
+Work in \fIworkdir\fR\&.
+.SH "EXAMPLES"
+.PP
+.PP
+Remove the oldest flow files in \fI/flows/krc4\fR until
+the total storage is less then 2 Gigabytes.
+.PP
+\fBflow-expire -E2Gig -w /flows/krc4\fR
+.PP
+.PP
+Remove the oldest flow files in \fI/flows/krc4\fR until
+the total number of files is less then 100.
+.PP
